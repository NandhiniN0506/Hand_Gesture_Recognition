**Hand Gesture Recognition**

Hand gesture recognition uses computer vision and machine learning to interpret human hand movements for intuitive interaction with digital devices. It has applications in virtual reality, sign language translation, and human-computer interaction.

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system is capable of recognizing various hand gestures in real-time, which can be used in different applications such as virtual reality, sign language translation, and human-computer interaction.

**System Requirements**

              * Python 3.7 or higher
              * OpenCV
              * NumPy
              * TensorFlow or PyTorch
              * Scikit-learn
              * Matplotlib
              * Installation

**Dataset**

The dataset should consist of images of hand gestures, organized in subdirectories named after the gesture classes (e.g., thumbs_up, thumbs_down, peace). Ensure that the dataset is placed in the data directory before running the preprocessing script.

**Model Training**

The model can be trained using either TensorFlow or PyTorch. The training script train.py handles the training process, including data loading, model training, and saving the trained model.

**Evaluation**

The model can be evaluated using the evaluate.py script. This script loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on the test dataset, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
